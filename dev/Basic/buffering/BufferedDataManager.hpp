 * non-templatized pointers and perform "flip" operations on them.
 *
 * A BufferedBase must be associate with a BufferedDataManager; otherwise, its current value will never
 * be updated.
 *
 * \note
 * This class is non-copyable; it is not clear semantically what happens when a Buffered data
 * item is copied. In particular, who should now manage this class? If a copy is needed, consider
 * implementing a "clone" function in BufferedDataManager, since this will allow exact control
 * over data management (and BufferedDataManager is already a friend class).

 *
 * \todo
 * It seems sensible to have beginManaging() add the datum to a static array of raw "data", using
 * the "size" of the buffered type. The next_ and current_ values can then be represented by two
 * large static arrays, which can be flipped with a single pointer swap. Care should be taken to
 * update the arrays when they grow too big. In addition, internal segmentation will develop
 * when an item is removed through a call to stopManaging(). So, it's not a trivial feature, but
 * then again there's plenty of existing research (for dealing with general memory allocation).
