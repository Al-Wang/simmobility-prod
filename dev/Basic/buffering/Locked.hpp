/**
 * Templatized wrapper for locked objects.
 *
 * A Locked datum handle multiple readers and a single writer through locking. The "set" and "get"
 *  methods ensure mutual exclusion. The "flip" method is an artifact of BufferedBase and does nothing.
 *
 * The spoken semantics of this template are sensible; for example:
 *   Locked<int>
 * ...is a "Locked int".
 *
 *  \todo It seems that Locked<primitive> shouldn't have to lock on get(), but I'll have to look into this.
 *
 *   \par
 *   I extended BufferedBase so that Buffered and Locked objects are effectively indistinguishable. Currently,
 *   we will definitely use locked types in the mid-term simulator. But a modeler might want to use a Locked
 *   type in the short-term for, say, fast, infrequent inter-agent communication that shouldn't be delayed a turn.
 *   In this case, the engine should allow it.
 *
 *   \par
 *   Note that assigning a Locked class to a BufferedDataManager is wasteful, but effectively harmless.
 *
