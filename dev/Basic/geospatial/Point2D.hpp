 * Simple storage class for geospatial items in the road network. In general, everything within a
 * road network is defined in reference to its Point2D location. Road segments are defined by 2
 * nodes (each node containing a point):  one at the beginning of the segment and another at the end.
 * Intersections are defined by a point at the intersection of all roads that join at that point.
 *
 * The Point2D location of any item should be accurate enough to generate a reasonable visualization
 * of that item using its Point(s) alone.
 *
 * X and Y position are defined in centimeters. Due to the current projection of any given zone, it
 * is perfectly normal for x/y to be negative.
