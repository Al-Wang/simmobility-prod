/**
 * A simple class representing a timeslice of the simulation.
 *
 * For a discrete time-stepped simulation like Sim Mobility, a single timeslice is updated
 * all at once (conceptually). Thus, we can say "frame 10" is updated all at once. This
 * "frame" is similar to a frame in film, and can be seen as a static view of the world at that given time "tick".
 *
 * In addition to the current frame, the current timeslice also stores the offset in ms from the start of the
 * simulation. This is easy to compute externally, but since this single computation is performed so many times by
 * so many Agents, we hope to minimize errors by consolidating it here. A timeslice is constant once constructed.
 *
 * Note that, for 32-bit unsigned integers, the maximum simulation time (based on the ms value) is just over 49
 * days. This does not depend on the time-step of the simulation.
