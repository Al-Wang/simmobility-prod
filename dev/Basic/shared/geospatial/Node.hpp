 * location. Additional information (such as lane connectors) are located in other classes (e.g.,
 * Intersections, Roundabouts, and SegmentNodes.

 *
 * Nodes should not be constructed directly. Instead, they exist to provide a uniform interface
 * to define locations in a RoadNetwork. UniNodes and MultiNodes (and their subclasses) provide
 * more comprehensive functionality, and their sub-classes provide even more.
