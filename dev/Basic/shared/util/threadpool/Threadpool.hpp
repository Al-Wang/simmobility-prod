 * An implementation of threadpool using boost features: asio and threadgroup
 * this pool can run several types of methods at the same time.
 *
 * how to use:
 * for assigning a method of a class to threadpool 'pool' just call  pool.enqueue(&MyClass::myMethod, pointer-toObject, arg1,arg2,arg3...);//usually pointer-toObject is nothing but 'this'.
 *
 * how it works:
 * 'io_service' itself is assigned to 'boost::asio::io_service::work' so that it doesn't stop running after its current task is over(to be available for the next job).
 * a group of threads run io_service.run() simultaneously.
 * multithreaded tasks are assigned to the pool using io_service.post() which will manage assignment of tasks to the threads.

/**
 * second version of threadpool is used ONLY for SPECIAL cases where user insists to complete different batches of tasks
 * serially using the same thread pool. For example, each group of tasks needs a separate profiling, so a series of thread groups need to be executed serially.
 *  In such a case, user expects the thread pool to notify the user when all the threads
 * are over. This is simply done by invoking the origina tasks along with a condition variable. As soon as a thread concludes,
 * a notification is generated. The user can act accordingly when ALL threads have concluded their jobs.(i purposefully used
 * the term 'conclude' rather that 'join' as the threads simply running io_service not the input tasks. Input tasks are executed
 * by the io_services running within the threads.
 * Important Note:
 * Regardless of how many batches used and how many times wait(0 is called,  wait() MUST be called before calling the destructor. otherwisem there will be unhandled exceptions waiting for you.
 * Most probably, this is temporary and fixes will be added. Until then, use this class with caution.
