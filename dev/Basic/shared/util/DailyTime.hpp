/**
 * Simple class to represent any point in time during a single day.
 *
 * \author Seth N. Hetu
 * \author Xu Yan
 *
 * This class is based on the ISO 8601 standard, with the following restrictions:
 *   \li No date may be specified, only times.
 *   \li Times must be of the format HH:MM:SS  --the colon is not optional.
 *   \li Only the seconds component may have a fractional component: HH:MM:SS.ffff..fff
 *   \li Hours and minutes are mandatory. Seconds (and second fractions) are optional.
 *   \li The hour 24 cannot be used.
 *
 * \note
 * Many of these constraints are not enforced, but may be in the future. ~Seth
 *
 *
 * All times are constant once created. (If we need modifiers later, we should probably use
 *    functions like "addSeconds", which return a different DailyTime object.)
