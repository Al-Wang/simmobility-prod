/**
 * Templatized wrapper for buffered objects.
 *
 * \author LIM Fung Chai
 * \author Seth N. Hetu
 *
 * A Buffered datum handle multiple readers and a single writer without
 * locking. The "flip" method is used to update the current value after calling "set".
 *
 * The spoken semantics of this template are sensible; for example:
 *   Buffered<int>
 * ...is a "Buffered int".
 *
 * \note
 * Do not delete this class until we decide what to do with it. See Shared.hpp for more information.
 *
 *  \todo Currently, Buffered types don't work well with classes. For example, if
 *  we have a "Buffered<Point> pos", then calling "pos.get().xPos = 10" will
 *  not work. You need to do something like "Point newPos(10, 20); pos.set(newPos)", which
 *  is pretty arbitrary and counter-intuitive. One option is to make a BufferedPoint2D class
 *  which extends BufferedBase, and give it "setXPos()" and "setYPos()" methods.
 *
 *   \par
 *   However, I think there must be a better way to do this without sacrificing the Buffered class's
 *   nice template syntax. This will only really become an issue later, when we release the API, so
 *   I'd rather think about a good solution for a while, instead of creating tons of customized BufferedXYZ
 *   pseudo-wrappers.
 *
 *   \par
 *   ~Seth
 *
 *   \note
 *   Since get returns a constant ref, pos.get().xPos = 10 won't compile anyway. But we may still need a solution.
