1)Function setupIndexMaps() will generate link_maps and crossing_maps based on the angle of each link wrt the main xy coordiante
this generation for "each" signalled intersection can be lengthy. isn't it better t shift this to 
road network editor and define an xml format in the road items section?

2)determining angle of link at each intersection is based upon the link which can even be a curved line whose angle is not very accurate. 
isn't it better we calculate the angle based on a more accurate element like segment->lane->polylines(actually final couple of polylines) ?

3) is there a five way intersection in singapore? how are they implemented?
