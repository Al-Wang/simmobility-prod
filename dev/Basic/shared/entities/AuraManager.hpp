 * \author Seth N. Hetu
 *
 * To locate nearby agents, calculate 2 points to form the search rectangle before calling
 * agentsInRect(). 
 *   \code
 *   Point p1 = ...;
 *   Point p2 = ...;
 *   const std::vector<const Agent*> nearby_agents = AuraManager::instance().agentsInRect(p1, p2);
 *   \endcode
 *
 * Alternatively if an agent is located on a lane, it can call nearbyAgents(), passing in its
 * current position and lane, and the distance forward and behind its current position.
 *
 * Both methods return an array of Agent's.  It is the responsibility of the caller to determine
 * the type (i.e. the current role) of each agent.
