/**
 * The LoopDetectorEntity is an entity that models all the loop-detectors located just before the
 * stop-line on all vehicle lanes approaching a Signal.
 *
 * \author LIM Fung Chai
 *
 * Each LoopDetectorEntity object must run at the same rate as the Driver objects.  This
 * implementation assumes this is so.
 *
 * For each loop detector, the entity counts the number of vehicles crossing the detector and
 * the total amount of time that no vehicle is hovering over the detector.  The time attribute
 * is known as the total "space-time".
 *
 * The LoopDetectorEntity expects its Signal object to reset the vehicle count and space-time
 * attributes periodically via the reset() method.
 *
 * There will definitely be a race condition with respect to calls to the update() and reset()
 * methods.  Although the LoopDetectorEntity objects run at a more frequent rate than the Signal
 * objects, there will be frames during which both objects run.  Because the objects are managed
 * by different Worker objects, the order in which they run is not deterministic.  The vehicle
 * count and space-time values may be different if the order of the calls to the update() and
 * reset() methods is different.  From a modeling point of view, this difference will not be
 * significant.  However it does introduce some randomness into each simulation run.
