/**
 * The LoopDetectorEntity is an entity that models all the loop-detectors located just before the
 * stop-line on all vehicle lanes approaching a Signal.
 *
 * \author LIM Fung Chai
 *
 * Each LoopDetectorEntity object must run at the same rate as the Driver objects.  This
 * implementation assumes this is so.
 *
 * For each loop detector, the entity counts the number of vehicles crossing the detector and
 * the total amount of time that no vehicle is hovering over the detector.  The time attribute
 * is known as the total "space-time".
 *
 * The LoopDetectorEntity expects its Signal object to reset the vehicle count and space-time
 * attributes periodically via the reset() method.
 *
 * There will definitely be a race condition with respect to calls to the update() and reset()
 * methods.  Although the LoopDetectorEntity objects run at a more frequent rate than the Signal
 * objects, there will be frames during which both objects run.  Because the objects are managed
 * by different Worker objects, the order in which they run is not deterministic.  The vehicle
 * count and space-time values may be different if the order of the calls to the update() and
 * reset() methods is different.  From a modeling point of view, this difference will not be
 * significant.  However it does introduce some randomness into each simulation run.

// The LoopDetector class actually models a monitoring area surrounding and centered at a loop
// detector and oriented in the same direction as the loop detector.  The width of the area is that
// of the lane, and the loop-detector's width is assumed to be a few centimeters narrower than the
// lane's width.  The length of the monitoring area include an area before and after the loop
// detector.  This is the outer area, while the inner area matches the area occupied by the loop
// detector.  See the comment in LoopDetectorEntity::Impl::Impl() below.
//
// Since most loop detectors are not aligned to the X- and Y- axes, the monitoring area is a 2D
// Object-oriented Bounding Box (OBB).  The OBB implementation has a center, 2 normalized
// orientations and 2 scalars representing the length and width of the OBB.  <orientationL_>
// represents the orientation of the OBB along the length of the monitoring area.  <innerLength_>
// is exactly half the length of the loop detector while 2 * <outerLength_> represents the full
// length of the OBB.  That is, the length of the outer area before (or after) the loop detector
// is outerLength_ - innerLength_.
