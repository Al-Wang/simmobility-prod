 * Worker wrapper, similar to thread_group but using barriers.
 * A SimpleWorkGroup provides a convenient wrapper for Workers, similarly to
 *   how a ThreadGroup manages threads. The main difference is that the number of
 *   worker threads cannot be changed once the object has been constructed.
 * A SimpleWorkGroup maintains one extra hold on the shared barrier; to "advance"
 *   a group, call SimpleWorkGroup::wait().
