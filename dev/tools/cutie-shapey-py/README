Intro
=====

This application renders the shape-files.  It expects the path to the folder containing the
shape files for road-attributes, arrow-markings, kerb-lines, lane-markings, bus-stops, and
traffic-signals.

Usage
=====

Invoke "./bugis <path>" to view the Bugis Road area or "./dover <path>" to view the Dover Road
area, where path is the folder containing the shape-files.  As the shape-files were provided to
us on a Non-Disclosure Agreement, you may not have access to the shape files.  Please seek someone
who has.

To-do
=====
1.  Render the arrow markings.
2.  Render the bus stops.
3.  Render the traffic signals.
4.  Improve on the lane markings and kerb lines.
5.  Improve on the GUI; eg, a way to search for any object.

Observations
============

1.  The shape files are excellent, very detailed.  Show stop lines (for vehicle before any
pedestrian crossing), bus zone, bus bays, yellow boxes, etc.

2.  Not sure if we can extract the lane connection easily or not.
