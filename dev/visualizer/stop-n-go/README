The application here is a visualizer for SimMobility.

You would need to do the following step once before you can use the visualizer:
    pyuic4 -o ui_controller.py controller.ui
or
    make
in a shell.

To run the visualizer, run
    ./stop-n-go
or
    ./stop-n-go <simulator-log-file>
The simulator-log-file may be in compressed form by gzip or bzip2.
