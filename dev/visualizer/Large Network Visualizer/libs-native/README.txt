NOTE: xuggler is a native encoding library. If you want to export videos directly from the Large Network Visualizer, please perform the
following steps:

   1) Download the appropriate archive from /home/sethhetu/libs on the FM server:
      A) For 32-bit systems:
      scp 172.18.127.157:/home/sethhetu/libs/xuggler_libs_32.tar.bz2 .

      B) For 64-bit systems:
      scp 172.18.127.157:/home/sethhetu/libs/xuggler_libs_64.tar.bz2 .

   3) Extract the contents of the archive you downloaded into THIS directory (libs-native).

   4) Now you can encode videos directly from the Visualizer.

If you prefer to download/compile xuggler from scratch, the official web site is here:

We are currently using Xuggler LGPL 3.4 - "Forrest".
